title: "Full Stack Or Not?"
---

Many job descriptions include the title "full stack developer". But this is a very broad term&mdash;do full stack developers have to be experts on every level of the stack? Or do they have to know what's happening on every level in general but are specialized in only one or two levels? I clearly support the latter, because being an expert on every level is just not feasible and doesn't reflect the reality in software development.
